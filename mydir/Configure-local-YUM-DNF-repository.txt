Configuring-Local-yum/dnf repository:

If we want to install a package and we won't have subscription then we have to configure local repository.

/dev/sr0 has the iso image file of system.

Which is automatically mounted at /run/media/root/RHEL-8-1-0-BaseOS-x86_64.

essentianal directory for local repo configurtaion:

/AppStream   (Apps related packages are available in AppStream dir)

/BaseOS      (OS related packages are available in BaseOS dir)

mkdir -p /dir (creating a parent directory to mount iso image dvd).

mount /dev/sr0 /localrepo/

--mounta /dev/cdrom /localrepo


cd /etc/yum.repos.d/ (we have to create a file with .repo extention here).

vim local.repo 

[repo-id]    (mention-repo-id without space u can give it any random name)

name=reponame (you can mention any repo name without space).
metdata_expire=-1 (we can -1 or never so that metadata won't expire)
gpgcheck=1 (we are enabling gpgcheck to check the authenticity of packages, we can set 0 to disable it).
enabled=1 (we are setting 1 to enable repo, if we want to disable it, then we have to mention 0).
basurl=file://repo-dir-path (full path of the directory u want to use as repo)
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release  (full path of /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release file to check key authenticity).

etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf ( enter enabled=0 to disable unwanted messages).

cat /etc/yum.conf (we can make global settings related to yum and repo)
[main]
gpgcheck=1
installonly_limit=3
clean_requirements_on_remove=True
best=True


dnf config-manager --add-repo=file://repo-dir-path (to install repo using commands)
dnf config-manager --add-repo=url (install repo using url)

yum clean all (to clean cache file of yum).

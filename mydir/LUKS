--------Linux unified key setup(LUKS)--------:


Usage: LUKS is used doe encrypting Disks and Disk's partitions.

Steps to enable LUKS in Disk or Disk partition:

1. cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/block-device-name (setting passwd for disk).

2. cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/block-device-name filename (making entry in /dev/mapper using a file).

3. cryptsetup status filename (to check the entries in /dev/mapper of file).

4. mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/filename (formatting FS).

5. mount /dev/mapper/filename /dir (mounting FS in directory).

6. touch cryptfile (creating an empty file "you can have any file-name")

7. cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/block-device-name cryptfile-path (storing key of the block-device to /root/crypt_file)

8. vim /etc/crypttab (opening file crypttab).

filename /dev/block-device-name cryptfile-path

save and quit.

9. make entry in /etc/fstab file.

10. mount -a 


How to close the LUKS:

1. umount dir/ (unmounting dir which was mounted on luks disk).

2. cryptsetup luksClose filename (closing LUKS utitity on the file).

3. cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/block-device-name (removing LUKS key from Disk).

4. cryptsetup remove /dev/block-device-name (removing LUKS utility from Disk).

5. rm cryptfile (removing cryptfile which we used to store passwd which was used during booting).

6. # the entry in /etc/crypttab

7. # the entry in /etc/fstab 

Done

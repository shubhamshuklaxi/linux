-----*Process Management in Linux*-----:

Definition: a compiled source code that runs into the system uses RAM is known as process.

1. each process has a unique id alloted by the system to identify it individualy.

2. When a process stops running it dies or we can kill process manaully.

3. A process which stops when system shutdown and starts autumatically when again system starts called as daemon process and deamons never die.

4. A process which has been killed still it shows in system known as zombie process a zombie process can not be killed as it's already dead, it does'nt uses system resources.

parent process id(PPID):

A process which runs multiple or a single process under it is known as parent process.

systemd is a parent process , all processes of the system run under the systemd process.

--- echo $$ or ps -C shell-name to show the process id of current shell.

--- echo $PPID to show PPID of current shell.

--- ps -C process-name or pidof process-name to show pid of any process.


Fork: when an original process split itself into another process is called forked.

Fork and Exec: when an original processs forked itself and creates and identical copy of it's child process is knows as forked and exec.

Below is example of fork and exec:

[root@shubham ~]# echo $$
10846
[root@shubham ~]# echo $PPID
4846
[root@shubham ~]# zsh
[root@shubham]~# exec bash
[root@shubham ~]# exit
[root@shubham ~]# echo $$
10846
[root@shubham ~]# echo $PPID
4846
[root@shubham ~]# zsh
[root@shubham]~# echo $$
13100
[root@shubham]~# echo $PPID
10846
[root@shubham]~# exec bash
[root@shubham ~]# echo $$
13100
[root@shubham ~]# echo $PPID
10846
 

ps fx to display details of all running process in system.

Processes are displayed in the below format:

PID(process-id).
 
TTY(terminal).
      
STAT(process-state).   

TIME(cumulative CPU time). 

COMMAND(see args.  (alias args, command)).

ps -ef is also used to display details of all running process in system.

Processes are displayed in the below format:

UID(user-id).

PID(process-id).  

PPID(parent-process-id).

C(CPU utilization). 

STIME(start-time). 

TTY(the device number of the controlling tty).  

TIME(cumulative CPU time). 

CMD(see args.  (alias args, command)).


PROCESS STATE CODES:
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will
       display to describe the state of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:

               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group



pgrep process-name to grep processes.

pstree to display process tree.

pstree -p to display pstree with process-id.

pstree -p -u username to display process run by the user.

pstree -p -s pid to display process tree. 


Steps to kill process using various way:

kill -l

kill -15 pid (to terminate a running process).

kill -9 pid (to kill process from kernel).

kill -19 pid (to stop process).

kill -18 pid (to start stopped process using kill -19 signal).

pkill psname (to kill all process start with the mentioned name).

killall psname1 psname2 (to kill multiple process using prefix).

strace -p pid (to trace process using pid).

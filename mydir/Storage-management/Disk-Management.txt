----------Disk-Management----------

--Storage devices are known as block devices which are available under /dev/ directory.

--lsblk to display all block devices in the system.

--lsblk -l to long list all block devices.

--lsblk -f to display filesystem name mountpoint and uuid.

--fdisk -l to display all attached block devices in details.

--fdisk -l /dev/block-device-name to display info about a particular block device.

--using fdisk command we can create 4 partition (3 primary and 1 extended).

--dmesg to display kernel ring buffer messages.

--lshw to display disk details.

--lsscsi to display scsi disk details.

--cat /proc/scsi/scsi display scsi disk details.

--badblocks -ws /dev/block-device-name to erase all data of block device.

--dd if=dev/zero of=dev/block-device-name to erase all data of block device.

--MBR disk=(3 primary partition 1 extended and n number of logical partition).

--cat /proc/partitions to display partitions and block-devices.

--fdisk /dev/block-device-name to create partition.

--partprobe /dev/block-device-name to scan disk in the system.

--mkfs.filesystem type /dev/block-device-name to format disk.

--mount /dev/block-device-name /dir to mount block device in the directory.

--umount /dev/block-device-name to unmount block device from directory. 

--dmidecode -t1 to display system information.

----------File-system formating------------

--file system is the way of organizing file.

--cat /proc/filesystems to display all supported file system.

--cat /etc/filesystems auto detected file system.

--ext2 second extended file system

--it does not support journaling

--it takes too much time for checking files.

--ext3 third extented file system

--similar with ext2 but supports journaling.

--ext4 fourth extended file system.

--support journaling and long file size.

--xfs not reducable.

--vfat= fat fat 12, fat 32 & msdos.

--iso 9660 = ISO image of cd/dvd.

--swap 

--gfs use clustring

--blkid /dev/block-device-name to check uuid, block size and type of filesystem.

--lsblk -f same as blkid 

--tune2fs -l /dev/block-dev-name |grep -i "block count"

to display block count

--tune2fs -m10 /dev/block-dev-name|grep -i "block count" change block %.

--vim /etc/fstab to permanently mount file system

-------below is the format for the entry of file system---------:

1. uuid mount-point filesystem-type options 0(dumping) 0(file system check order).

2. cat /proc/mounts to display mounted file system details.

3 .cat /proc/mtab same as above but its not updated by kernel.

4. df -Th to display mounted filesystem with its type.

5. du -sh /dir to disply size of the directory

6. du -Sh /dir to display size in details of directory.

7. mount -t FStype source -o options(rw,ro,noacl,noexec etc) mountpoint.

---------changing file system without unmounting directory---------

1. mket2s or mkfs.ext2 /dev/block-device-name (to format disk as ext2 FS).

2. tune2fs -l /dev/block-device-name|grep -w features (to check journaling feature of FS).

3. blkid /dev/block-device-name to check UUID, Block-Size and FStype.

-----To convert ext2 to ext3 with an existing FS without data loss follow the below steps:

1. umount the /dir

2. tune2fs -j /dev/block-device-name. (will create journal as well as it will convert FS from ext2 to ext3).

3. mount the FS into the /dir.
 
-----To convert ext3 to ext4 with an existing FS without data loss follow the below steps:

1. umount the /dir

2. tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/block-device-name (it will convert FS from ext3 to ext4).

3. mount the FS into the /dir.

-----Steps to enable and disable journaling features:

1. tune2fs -l /dev/block-device-name|grep -w features (to check journaling feature "it should have has_journal").

2. umount the /dir

3. tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/block-device-name (to disable journaling).

4. tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/block-device-name (to enable journaling).

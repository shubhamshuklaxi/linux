press m in keyboard to short process by memory-utilization desc.

press shift+p in keyboard to short process by cpu utilization desc.

press shift+m in keyboard to short process by process id number desc.

press shift+t in keyboard to short process by time desc.

press shift+t in keyboard to process as threads.

press shift+t in keyboard to view process as tasks.

top -u username to view process run by the specific user.

top p pid to view a particular pid detail.

priority_value = nice_value + 20.


Priority value - The priority value is process's actual priority which is used by kernel to schedule a task.

In linux system priorities are 0 - 139 in which 99 for real time and 100 - 139 for users.

Nice value - Nice values are user-space values that we can use to control the priority of a process.

The nice value range is -20 to +19 where -20 is highest and +19 is lowest.

Only root user can assign - nice value whether normal user can assign 0 to +19 nice value.


nice -n nice-value pid & (to start a process with nice-value & used for sending process in background)

renice -n nice-value pid (to reset the nice value of the process).


jobs -p to get pid of process.

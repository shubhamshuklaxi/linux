Profile Files Overview:

There are two main types of profile files:

    System Profile Files
    User Profile Files

System Profile Files

    /etc/profile: This file is responsible for setting system-wide environment variables like PATH, PS1 (the command prompt appearance), and HOSTNAME. It also runs the /etc/inputrc and /etc/bashrc files.

User Profile Files

User profile files are located in the home directory of each user.

Here are the main user profile files:

    .bash_history: This file saves the commands you run in the terminal. It is updated after you log out.

    .bash_logout: This file is executed when you log out. It lets the system know you've ended your session.

    .bash_profile: This file is executed when you log in. It typically sets the $HOME variable and sources (loads) the ./bashrc file to apply user-specific settings.

    .bashrc: This file is run every time you start a new terminal session. It sources the system-wide /etc/bashrc file and sets up the environment for each shell session.

Note: All of these files are copied from the /etc/skel directory when a new user is created.

-----File Security in Linux-------:

R(read)=4
w(write)=2
x(execute)=1

permissions can be between 0 to 7 max.


If u excute the ll -ah command in any directory u will get the file details in below format:

1. inode-number. 

2. filetype and permissions. 

filetype:ownerperm:groupperm:otheruserperm

1 char  :3 char   :3 char   :3 char

types of filetype.

- normal file.

d directory.

l symbolic link.

p named pipe.

b block device.

c character device.

s socket. 

3. link-number.

4. owner. 

5. group. 

6. size. 

7. month-date-time. 

8. filename.

chown username file or directory name (to change the owner of the file or dir).

chgrp groupname file or directory name (to change the group of the file or dir).

chown username:groupname file or directory (to change the owner and group simultaneously).

always asign 7 and 5 perm to group and 7 perm to owner.

chmod perm-in-octal-mode file or dir name (to asign perm using octal mode to perm).

chmod perm-in-char file or dir name (to asign perm using char mode to perm).

Ways to assign permissions:

g+perm to adding perm for group.
u+perm to adding perm for user or owner.
o+perm to adding perm for other users.


g-perm to remove perm for group.
u-perm to remove perm for user or owner.
o-perm to remove perm for other users.

u or g or o=rwx for full perm,

u or g or o=rw  for read write only.

u or g or o=r   for read only.

u or g or o=    for no perm.


We can give permission to user(owner) group and other users at once by using "," between the the u,g,o.

eg:

chmod u+rwx, g+rx, o+r file or dir name.


umask= 1st digit for special perm, last three digits to assign perm for u,g and o.


666 - 022=644= effective perm for file by default in umask.

777 - 022=755=effective perm for directory by default in umask.

chmod 644 file (best perm for file)

chmod u=xr,g=r,o=r file.

chmod 755 dir (best perm for dir).


cp -p to preserve timestamp for file or dir after copying.

we can set the custm umask value .bashrc file.

umask -S to see umask value in char.

umask -s u=perm,g=perm,o=perm to set umask value using chars.

Advance File permissions:

1.stikybit

chmod +t file or dir. (if apply stiky bit it forces creater only access to the file).

chmod 1755 file or dir. (enabling stiky bit using octal method).

drwxrwxrwt. with execute permission.

drwxrwx--T. without execute permission.

chmod -t file or dir. (revoking stiky bit).

chmod 0755 file or dir (revoking stiky bit using octal method).

2. setgid (groupid bit).

setgid bit enables group of the directory to the default group of all file inside the directory.

chmod g+s Dir/ . (enabling setgid bit on directory using char method).

chmod 2755 Dir/ . (enabling setgid bit on directory using octal method).

chmod g-s Dir/ . (disabling setgid bit on directory using char method).

chmod 0755 Dir/ . (disabling setgid bit on directory using octal method).

drwxrws---. with exec option.

drw-rwS---. without exec option.

3. setuid (userid bit).

setuid bit on file enables file to be executed as it's owner.


chmod u+s Dir/ . (enabling setuid bit on directory using char method).

chmod 4755 Dir/ . (enabling setuid bit on directory using octal method).

chmod u-s Dir/ . (disabling setuid bit on directory using char method).

chmod 0755 Dir/ . (disabling setuid bit on directory using octal method).

-rwsr--r--. with exec option.

-rwSr--r--. without exec option.

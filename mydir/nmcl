       nmcli -f active connection show "My default em1"
           shows details for "My default em1" active connection, like IP, DHCP information, etc.

       nmcli -f profile con s "My wired connection"
           shows static configuration details of the connection profile with "My wired connection" name.

       nmcli -p con up "My wired connection" ifname eth0
           activates the connection profile with name "My wired connection" on interface eth0. The -p option
           makes nmcli show progress of the activation.

       nmcli con up 6b028a27-6dc9-4411-9886-e9ad1dd43761 ap 00:3A:98:7C:42:D3

           00:3A:98:7C:42:D3.

       nmcli device status
           shows the status for all devices.

       nmcli dev disconnect em2
           disconnects a connection on interface em2 and marks the device as unavailable for auto-connecting.
           As a result, no connection will automatically be activated on the device until the device's
           'autoconnect' is set to TRUE or the user manually activates a connection.

       nmcli -f GENERAL,WIFI-PROPERTIES dev show wlan0
           shows details for wlan0 interface; only GENERAL and WIFI-PROPERTIES sections will be shown.

       nmcli -f CONNECTIONS device show wlp3s0
           shows all available connection profiles for your Wi-Fi interface wlp3s0.

       nmcli dev wifi
           lists available Wi-Fi access points known to NetworkManager.

       nmcli dev wifi con "Cafe Hotspot 1" password caffeine name "My cafe"
           creates a new connection named "My cafe" and then connects it to "Cafe Hotspot 1" SSID using
           password "caffeine". This is mainly useful when connecting to "Cafe Hotspot 1" for the first time.
           Next time, it is better to use nmcli con up id "My cafe" so that the existing connection profile
           can be used and no additional is created.

       nmcli -s dev wifi hotspot con-name QuickHotspot
           creates a hotspot profile and connects it. Prints the hotspot password the user should use to
           connect to the hotspot from other devices.

       nmcli dev modify em1 ipv6.address 2001:db8::a:bad:c0de
           temporarily adds an IP address to a device. The address will be removed when the same connection
           is activated again.

       nmcli connection add type ethernet autoconnect no ifname eth0

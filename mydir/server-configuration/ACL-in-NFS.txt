ACE PERMISSIONS:
    There are a variety of different ACE permissions (13 for files, 14 for direc‐
    tories), each represented by a single character.  An ACE should have  one  or
    more of the following permissions specified:

    r      read-data (files) / list-directory (directories)

    w      write-data (files) / create-file (directories)

    a      append-data (files) / create-subdirectory (directories)

    x      execute (files) / change-directory (directories)

    d      delete  - delete the file/directory.  Some servers will allow a delete
           to occur if either this permission is set in the file/directory or  if
           the delete-child permission is set in its parent directory.

    D      delete-child  -  remove  a  file or subdirectory from within the given
           directory (directories only)

    t      read-attributes - read the attributes of the file/directory.

    T      write-attributes - write the attributes of the file/directory.

    n      read-named-attributes - read the named attributes of  the  file/direc‐
           tory.

    N      write-named-attributes - write the named attributes of the file/direc‐
           tory.

    c      read-ACL - read the file/directory NFSv4 ACL.

    C      write-ACL - write the file/directory NFSv4 ACL.

    o      write-owner - change ownership of the file/directory.

    y      synchronize - allow clients to use synchronous I/O with the server.

nfs4_setfacl -x A::uid:RWX file-name (to give special to other user in nfs).

nfs4_setfacl -x A:g:gid:RWX file-name (to give special permission to group in nfs)

nfs4_editfacl file-name (to edit acl in nfs).

DNS (Domain Name System) 
Every Computer on internet uses DNS server.
The orgs have more than 1 DNS server.
Personel area networks have built in DNS server.

The domain name system or dns is a service on tcp/ip network that enables clients to translate names into ip-address.

Forward and reverse lookup queries:

The question a client asks a dns server is called a query.

When client queries for an ip-address, This is called forward lookup query:

[root@dns-server ~]# nslookup dns-server.shubham.local
Server:		192.168.123.161
Address:	192.168.123.161#53

Name:	dns-server.shubham.local
Address: 192.168.123.161


When client queries for a name, This is called reverse lookup query:

[root@dns-server ~]# nslookup 192.168.123.161
161.123.168.192.in-addr.arpa	name = dns-server.shubham.local.

To use a dns server we have mention ip of that dns server in /etc/resolv.conf file 

vim /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver dns-ip

:wq!

.arpa is used for reverse lookup via in-addr.arpa

Fully Qualified Domain Name(fqdn):

A fqdn is the combination of the hostname of a machine appended with its domain name.

domainname --fqdn (to check fqdn).

DNS Records:

A Records:

Which is also called a host record contains the ipv4 address of a computer
When a dns client queries a dns server for an a record, then the dns server
will resolve the hostname in the query to an ip-address.
An AAAA record is similar but contains and ipv6 address instead of ipv4.

PTR Record:

A PTR Record is the reverse of an A Record
It conatins the name of the computer and can be used to resolve an ip address to a hostname.

NS Record:

A NS Record or nameserver record is a record that points to a dns name server (in this zone).
You can list all your name server for dns zone in distinct NS Records.

glue A Record:

An A record that maps the name of a NS record to an ip address is said to be a glue A record.

SOA Record:

The SOA Record of a zone contains meta info about the zone itself.

The CNAME Record:

A CNAME Record maps a hostname to a hostname,
creating effectively an alis for an existing hostname.
the name of mail server is often called mail or smtp,
and the name of a webserver to www.

MX Record:

THE MX Record points to an smtp server. When you send and email to another domain,
then your mail server will need MX Record of the target domain's mail server.

#Extra Notes:

TTL stands for time to live

IN stands for internet


#Follow below steps to configure DNS server:

#Set Hostname:

hostnamectl set-hostname dns-server.shubham.local (You can set any hostname).

#Install Dependencies:

dnf install bind bind-utils -y

#Start and Enable named service:

systemctl enable --now named.service

#Create backup of named.conf file:

cp /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.bkp

#Now open named.conf file comment below two line of options function,at allow-query mention first 3 subnet of your server ip address same and last subnet should be 0 with ;and space also mention settings details for forward and reverse lookup zone:

vim /etc/named.conf

options {
//      listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
//      listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
        directory       "/var/named";
        dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db";
        statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt";
        memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt";
        secroots-file   "/var/named/data/named.secroots";
        recursing-file  "/var/named/data/named.recursing";
        allow-query     { localhost; 192.168.123.0/24; };


// Forward zone

zone "shubham.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "shubham.local.fw";
        allow-update { none; };
        allow-query {any; };
};

// Reverse Lookup Zone

zone "123.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
        type master;
        file "shubham.local.rv";
        allow-update { none; };
        allow-query {any; };
};

:wq!

#Now go into /etc/named and create forward and reverse lookup zone file that you have mentioned at /etc/named.conf:

cd /var/named/

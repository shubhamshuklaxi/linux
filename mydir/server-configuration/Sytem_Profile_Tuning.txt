Steps to enable Tuning:

1. yum install tuned* -y 

2. systemctl start tuned.service

3. systemctl enable tuned.service

4. /etc/tuned/  ( This directory has configuration files for tuning ).

5. /usr/lib/tuned/ ( Profile tuning files ).

6. tuned-adm active ( to Dispaly Current active profile ).

7. tuned-adm list ( to list Available profiles ).

Available profiles:
- accelerator-performance     - Throughput performance based tuning with disabled higher latency STOP states
- balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile
- desktop                     - Optimize for the desktop use-case
- hpc-compute                 - Optimize for HPC compute workloads
- intel-sst                   - Configure for Intel Speed Select Base Frequency
- latency-performance         - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
- network-latency             - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
- network-throughput          - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks
- optimize-serial-console     - Optimize for serial console use.
- powersave                   - Optimize for low power consumption
- throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads
- virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests

8. tuned-adm profile profile-name ( to change active profile ).

9. tuned-adm recommend ( to list best profile for system ).

10. tuned-adm off ( to off active profile ).
